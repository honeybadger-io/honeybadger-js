# Honeybadger RequireJS Example

Follow these steps to run the example:

1. Download require.js: `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jrburke/requirejs/master/require.js > require.js`
2. Visit *index.html* in a browser and check out the development console for log
   messages.

Note: for the error to be reported you need to access index.html through a valid host such as `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`. See [Development](https://github.com/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-js#development) to use our built-in development server.
