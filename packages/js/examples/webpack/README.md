# Honeybadger webpack Example

Follow these steps to run the example:

1. Install webpack: `npm install`
2. Compile the project: `npm run build`
3. Visit *index.html* in a browser and check out the development console for log
   messages.

Note: for the error to be reported you need to access index.html through a valid
host such as `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`. See
[Development](https://github.com/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-js#development) to
use our built-in development server.
